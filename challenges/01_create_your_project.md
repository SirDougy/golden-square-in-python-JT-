# Create Your Project

In this series of challenges you will build a project in a series of steps.

Before we get started, you'll need to set up a new Python project. Feel free to
create new projects whenever you like to organise your work across these
challenges.

This project will use a few components:

* **Python**  
  The programming language.

* **Pip**  
  A tool for managing dependencies in a Python project. A dependency is a piece
  of software someone else has written to help others build programs. In Python
  these dependencies are known as packages.

* **Pipenv**  
  A tool for managing the environments in which Python programs run. An
  environment includes the version of Python, the packages installed, and the
  versions of those packages.

* **Pytest**  
  A test framework for use with Python. A test framework is a tool for writing
  and running tests.

* **Git**  
  A version control system for use with any programming language. In the
  industry software projects are changed by many people in small steps, and
  version control systems help us keep track of those changes.

[To set up your project follow this
guide.](../pills/setting_up_a_pytest_project.md) 

Then move on to the next step.
